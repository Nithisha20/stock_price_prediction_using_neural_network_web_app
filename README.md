# stock_price_prediction_using_neural_network_web_app

Description: Developed a web-based application using Streamlit and TensorFlow to predict stock prices. The app allows users to input a stock ID and fetch historical data from Yahoo Finance, displaying key financial indicators like moving averages. It then uses a pre-trained LSTM model to forecast future stock prices. This project showcases my skills in data science, machine learning, and web development, focusing on creating an intuitive tool for financial forecasting.

Technologies Used: Python, TensorFlow, Streamlit, Yahoo Finance API, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.

Key Features:

Fetches real-time stock data.
Displays historical data with customizable moving averages.
Predicts future prices using LSTM-based neural networks.
User-friendly interface for financial analysis.
